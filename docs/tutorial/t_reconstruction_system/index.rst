Reconstruction system (Tensor)
===================================================================

This tutorial demonstrates volumetric RGB-D reconstruction and dense RGB-D SLAM with the :ref:`/tutorial/core/tensor.ipynb` and the :ref:`/tutorial/core/hashmap.ipynb` backend.

The tutorial can be run with a minimal dataset in ``examples/test_data/RGBD``, but it is recommended to run on real-world RGBD sequences to demonstrate its functionalities. Please refer to :ref:`/tutorial/geometry/rgbd_image.ipynb` for available datasets. The ``Redwood`` dataset is recommended.

If you use the hash map backend or the Tensor-based reconstruction system, please cite [Dong2021]_::

.. note::
   The tutorials for tensor-based offline reconstruction system, simultaneous localization and calibration (SLAC), and shape from shading (SfS) as mentioned in [Dong2021]_ are under construction. At current, please refer to :ref:`reconstruction_system` for the legacy versions.
